# AIR-QUALITY-MONITORING-AND-MODELLING

How can we use the openAir package in R to model and monitor air quality?

These scripts show how OPENAIR can be utilized to generate multiple plots using R programming language


scripts in Python are attached as files

I have included powerpoints and pdf of presentations at the Summer school on Air Quality.
